Our app uses the Leap Motion controller hardware to automate your music/videos on YouTube.

It uses a supervised machine learning library: leaptrainer.js to associate a hand gesture of your choice with a personal YouTube playlist.

The playlist can then be controlled with intuitive hand motions set for: Play, Pause, next Track, and previous Track.
